# Optimal Social Structure Identification Using Simulated Annealing\
#\
# Given a memory restriction and population size, simulated annealing is used to identify the optimal social structure abiding by the social contract. Where necessary, 'sa' must be set to the number of super-rememberers and super-rememberer ranks and memory must be passed as arguments.\
#\
# Please note: necessary error checks and tests have not been implemented, leading to code fragility.}
